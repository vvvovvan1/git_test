                    <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <i>Bouldering</i> is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small
                        rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or
                        harnesses.

                        Unlike <a class="green_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but
                        intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers
                        within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate
                        challenging sequences of moves.
